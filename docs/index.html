<p>Usergrid is an open-source Backend-as-a-Service (“BaaS” or “mBaaS”) composed of an integrated distributed NoSQL database, application layer and client tier with SDKs for developers looking to rapidly build web and/or mobile applications. It provides elementary services (user registration & management, data storage, file storage, queues) and retrieval features (full text search, geolocation search, joins) to power common app features.</p>

<p>It is a multi-tenant system designed for deployment to public cloud environments (such as Amazon Web Services, Rackspace, etc.) or to run on traditional server infrastructures so that anyone can run their own private BaaS deployment.</p>

<p>For architects and back-end teams, it aims to provide a distributed, easily extendable, operationally predictable and highly scalable solution. For front-end developers, it aims to simplify the development process by enabling them to rapidly build and operate mobile and web applications without requiring backend expertise.</p>
